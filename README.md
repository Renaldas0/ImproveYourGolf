- **Site Features**
  - The site is developed to be a single scroll page except for the register and login forms

  - The navbar is compact into a hamburger menu icon and is transparent if the page is at the complete top
  - Once the user scrolls for better user experience, the navbar is set to always be visible and a background colour appears
  - For extra functionality there is a button which if clicked simply scrolls down to the About Us section
  - Clicking on sections in the navbar scrolls the page down to that desired section

- **Classes**
  - The classes section is designed to look different for authenticated users and those who are not logged in
  - If a user is not logged in then a message at the bottom of the class description appears to inform a user they must first login
  - When a user logs in this message disappears and the 'Book Now' button appears
  - The responsive features set the columns to align from 3 across to a 2,1 layout and then in a row formation for mobile devices
  - Each class has a different image to indicate the type of lesson to expect

- **Coaches**
  - The coaches section consists of 2 images that show the coaches and a brief description
